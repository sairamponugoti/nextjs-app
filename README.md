# Next.js

- Next is a React frontend development web framework
- Created by Vercel
- Enables to create Full Stack Web Applications by extending latest React features
- Enables functionality such as SSR (Server Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation)

# SSR

- Unlike a traditional SPA where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client
- Next.js allows the first page load to be rendered by the server (Great for SEO & Performance)
- In CSR apps, if we View the Source Code we only see the basic HTML page with the root Div where we render our React/Angular/Vue code at later point of time using Javascript.
- This is bad for SEO because Search engine crawlers can't pick up our content
- Next.js Solves this issue by rendering our first page server side

# Next.js Benefits

- SSR (SEO & Performance)
